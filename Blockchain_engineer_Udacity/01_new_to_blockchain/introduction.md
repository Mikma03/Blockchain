# Introduction

Ledger - A blockchain is a distributed ledger, similar to a database, but rather than being controlled by a central authority (i.e., a firm like Google, small company, or individual) the ledger is dispersed across multiple computers, which can be located all over the world and run by anyone with an Internet connection

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**What Are Distributed Ledgers?**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people. It allows transactions to have public "witnesses." The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes.

A distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralized ledger, which is the type of ledger that most companies use. A centralized ledger is more prone to cyber attacks and fraud, as it has a single point of failure.

Underlying distributed ledgers is the same technology that is used by blockchain, which is the technology that is used by bitcoin. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger used by bitcoin.

# Hashing

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hashing is an idea you may already be familiar with. It's a way to create a digital fingerprint for a piece of data. It's a fundamental idea behind what makes the blockchain work. Understanding hashing will help you connect other ideas that we'll discuss later.

A hash algorithm turns an arbitrarily-large amount of data into a fixed-length hash. The same hash will always result from the same data, but modifying the data by even one bit will completely change the hash. Like all computer data, hashes are large numbers, and are usually written as hexadecimal.

BitCoin uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm to generate verifiably "random" numbers in a way that requires a predictable amount of CPU effort. Generating a SHA-256 hash with a value less than the current target solves a block and wins you some coins.

# Cryptographic hash function


<p>&nbsp;</p>

> [Link to more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)

Acryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the "message") to a bit array of a fixed size (the "hash value", "hash", or "message digest"). It is a one-way function, that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation.[1] Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.
