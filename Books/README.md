In 25 concise steps, this book teaches the basics of blockchain technology in a non-technical fashion. Besides the technical nature of blockchain this book does not require any previous knowledge in computer science, mathematics, programming or cryptography. Due to its didactic concept, this book provides a self-contained learning path through all the components of blockchain and their underlying technical concepts and principles.


If you want to learn how blockchain works, you may find yourself lost in a universe of books that either quickly skim through the technical concepts or that discuss the underlying technical principles at a highly mathematical level. The former may leave you unsatisfied because these books miss to explain the technical details necessary to understand and to appreciate blockchain while the latter may leave you unsatisfied because those books already require the knowledge you want to acquire. "Blockchain Basics" is different because it not only fills the gap between purely technical books and purely business-focused books but also teaches all concepts and principles of blockchain in a non-technical fashion. It does so by utilizing a didactic concept that is based on pictorial explanations, analogies, and metaphors.
